  <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that allows you to add interactivity, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and control the behavior of web pages. It's often referred to as the "language of the web" because it's the most commonly used programming language for building interactive and responsive web applications.</p>

<h3>Key Features of JavaScript:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript runs in the user's web browser, which means it's executed on the client-side. This enables dynamic updates and changes to web pages without the need for server communication.</li>

<li>Versatility: JavaScript can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple form validation to complex web applications. It's not limited to web development and can be used for server-side scripting (Node.js), game development, mobile app development, and more.</li>

<li>Event-Driven: JavaScript is event-driven, meaning it can respond to user interactions (e.g., clicks, mouse movements) and execute code in response to these events.</li>

<li>DOM Manipulation: JavaScript is used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing you to change the content and structure of web pages dynamically.</li>

<li>Open Source: JavaScript is open-source, and there is a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify web development.</li>

<li>Cross-Browser Compatibility: Modern JavaScript is designed to work consistently across various web browsers, ensuring that your code functions correctly on different platforms.</li>

    <h3>Basic JavaScript Syntax:</h3>
<p>JavaScript uses a C-style syntax and relies on a combination of variables, functions, and objects. Here's a simple example of JavaScript code:</p>
    <code> 
      // Declare a variable
let greeting = "Hello, World!";

// Define a function
function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
}

// Call the function
sayHello();

    </code>
    <p>In this example, a variable greeting is declared, a function sayHello is defined, and then the function is called to display a message in the console.</p>

    <header class="title">JavaScript and Java</header>

<p>JavaScript and Java are two distinct programming languages, despite their similar names. They have different origins, purposes, and usage. Here's a comparison of JavaScript vs. Java:</p>
<br>
<h4>Origin and History:</h4>

<p>JavaScript: JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995. It was originally called LiveScript but was later renamed JavaScript for marketing purposes. It was designed for use in web browsers to provide client-side interactivity.</p>
<br>
<p>Java: Java, on the other hand, was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems (which is now owned by Oracle). Java was released in 1995, but its development began earlier. It was designed as a general-purpose, platform-independent programming language.</p>
<br>
<h4>Type:</h4>

<p>JavaScript: JavaScript is a dynamically typed, high-level scripting language. It is primarily used for client-side web development.</p>
<br>
<p>Java: Java is a statically typed, high-level programming language. It can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, mobile app development, desktop applications, and more.</p>
<br>
<h4>Usage:</h4>

<p>JavaScript: JavaScript is mainly used for client-side web development. It's executed in web browsers and is responsible for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</p>
<br>
<p>Java: Java has a broader range of applications. It can be used for web development (typically on the server-side), Android app development, desktop application development, backend server applications, and more.</p>
<br>
<h4>Syntax:</h4>

<p>JavaScript: JavaScript has a C-style syntax, similar to many other programming languages. It is often used alongside HTML and CSS to create interactive web pages.</p>
<br>
<p>Java: Java also has a C-style syntax, but it's a more verbose language compared to JavaScript.</p>
<br>
<h4>Execution:</h4>

<p>JavaScript: JavaScript is executed by web browsers. It's primarily a client-side language, although it can be used on the server-side with technologies like Node.js.</p>
<br>
<p>Java: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows Java programs to be platform-independent.</p>
<br>
<h4>Typing:</h4>

<p>JavaScript: JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.</p>
<br>
<p>Java: Java is statically typed, so you must declare the data type of a variable when you define it.</p>
<br>
<h4>Community and Ecosystem:</h4>

<p>JavaScript: JavaScript has a vast and active community. It's known for its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.</p>
<br>
<p>Java: Java also has a large and active community. It's widely used in enterprise applications, and there are many libraries and frameworks available for various domains.</p>
<br>
<p>In summary, JavaScript and Java are two different languages with distinct use cases. JavaScript is mainly used for web development and client-side scripting, while Java is a general-purpose language that can be used for various applications, including web development (server-side), mobile app development, and more.</p>

   <section class="main-section" id="hello_world"> 
    <header class="title">Hello World</header>
    <p>"Hello, World!" is a simple, traditional program used to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a programming language. It's often the first program that beginners write when learning a new programming language. The program's purpose is to display the text "Hello, World!" on the screen or in the console, indicating that the language is correctly set up and running. Here's a breakdown of the "Hello, World!" program in some common programming languages:</p>
<h4>Python</h4>
    <code>print("Hello, World!")
</code>
<h4>Java</h4>
    <code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</code>
<h4>JavaScript</h4>
   <code><!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        document.write("Hello, World!");
    </script>
</body>
</html>
</code>
<h4>C</h4>
   <code>#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</code>
